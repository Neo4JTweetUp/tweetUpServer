Common
=======

Connecting like-minded people with Twitter

Intro
-----
Common is a public repo built by Hack Reactor students as a short-project.

Description
-----------
Common is a mobile app that makes friend recommendations to users, based on users' current locations and friends on Twitter.

The app uses Twitter login to get started. Based on the number of common friends and current locations, the app will give friend recommendations to users, that might be similar to the user in interests. The recommended profiles will be sorted by relevance, specified as the highest number of common friends. The results can be filtered by location and latest activity time. Users can send direct messages to connect with the recommended.
